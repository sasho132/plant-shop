# Plant Shop

[Demo](https://plant-shop.sasho1320.net)

This is an e-commerce site for shopping houseplants and accessories for them. The idea of this demo project is to create a working web application that allows creating/editing a profile, adding/removing items from the cart, buying desired items, etc.

The project app uses PostgreSQL for DB, PayPal for making payments and it's [hosted](https://plant-shop.sasho1320.net) on AWS.

This project was created for final exam of the course "Python Web Framework", and it is for demo purposes only.
